# The Lorentz Effect 🦋

This repository recordes my journey int `manim` (Mathematical Animation).
I started learning this becuase words sometimes aren't enough to capture the complexity
of a personality that is both a genuine soul and a mischievous spirit.

Physics tells us that the observer effects the observed.
This is my observation.
